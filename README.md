# Football-Scouting

As part of a software engineering course, I developed a desktop application in java that uses the javax.swing API.
The app manages a football player database for an agency that represents football players.
Technologies and Code principles i used:
- javax.swing
- MVC architecture pattern
- Design Patterns - Singleton, Factory, Observer
